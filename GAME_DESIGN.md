# CodeForge Rush: Game Design (12-22)

## Vision
A high-retention mobile game where players feel like they are hacking missions with visual code.

## Core Fantasy
"I am a cyber runner controlling a bot army by writing commands."

## Session Loop (45-90 sec)
1. Enter level
2. Drag code blocks into a tiny script
3. Run simulation
4. Win -> reward burst + next level prompt
5. Lose -> hint / retry / tweak script

## Addictive Retention Systems
- Daily streak with escalating rewards
- 5 daily missions
- Rank ladder and season badge
- Perfect run bonus
- Fast restart (no long fail screens)
- Cosmetic unlock economy

## Learning Map by Level Bands
- 1-300: sequence and direction
- 301-900: loops
- 901-1800: nested loops
- 1801-3000: conditions
- 3001-5000: function calls
- 5001-8000: variables and counters
- 8001-12000: optimization constraints
- 12001-15000: mixed challenge + speed meta

## Level Architecture
- Deterministic procedural generation by level number seed
- Stage = each 100 levels
- Grid grows from 5x5 to 12x12
- Hazard/wall density rises with stage
- Instruction limit enforces coding efficiency
- Par score enables perfect reward chase

## Safe Monetization
- Optional rewarded ad for hint
- Cosmetic pass only
- No hard paywall on educational progression

## Social Features (next)
- Weekly classroom leagues
- Friend race on same seed
- Share your code solution replay

## Content Velocity
Because levels are generated, shipping to 15,000 levels is immediate without manual authoring.
